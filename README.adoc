= TypeTrees

This library is intended to solve the use case of getting the erased types of
a (generic) parameter. Something which was possible in Scala 2 with `+TypeTag+`
and is now a bit more complex with Scala 3.

This is implemented thanks to a macro.

*Warning:* for most use cases, it needs to be part of a `+inline+` method.

== Usage

[source,scala]
----
include::{testdir}/CodeSamples.scala[tag=mainusage,indent=0]
----
<1> Get a `+TypeTreeTag+` for a generic type `+T+`
<2> Get a `+ClassTag+` for this type
<3> Get a `+TypeTreeTag+` for each type parameters if any

== Examples

The main usage is as follows, within a generic `+inline+` method:

[source,scala]
----
include::{testdir}/TestBehavior.scala[tag=exampleInlineDef,indent=0]
----

Or:

[source,scala]
----
include::{testdir}/TestBehavior.scala[tag=exampleInlineDefMap,indent=0]
----

It can also be applied to non generic types: in such case it doesn't need to
be part of a `+inline def+`.
